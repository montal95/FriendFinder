# FriendFinder
This full-stack site will take in results from user surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

This app includes data validation and links to the api of friends currently in the system. Future patches will prevent a user from entering the same info twice.
Feel free to access it on my Heroku: https://radiant-ridge-11872.herokuapp.com/
